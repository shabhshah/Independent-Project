# Independent-Project
This is a program that is being written for my independent project. I am trying to create a device which will allow for field testing of kidney function.

*imageprocesser.py* analyzes the selceted image and returns the percentage of the number of pixels with the color #ff7700. **requires PIL to be installed to work**
